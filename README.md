Some practice to brush up on my Python skills (trying to get comfortable with the git workflow and atomic commits: note the # of commits), and so I can work on more advanced repos'; it's also a collaboration effort with my friend Tanya..

This repo will continue up to, and including, simple threading files and applicationsðŸ§µ,and will eventually be a tutorial on python with exercises (alongside some notes on the basic toolkit of the language) and have solutions in a separate folder
