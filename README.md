Some practice to brush up on my Python skills (and get comfortable with the git workflow: notice the # of commits), so I can work on more advanced repos'; it's also a collaboration effort with my friend Tanya from Rublyovka..

Will continue up to, and including, simple threading files and applicationsðŸ§µ

This will eventually be a tutorial on python with exercises (alongside some notes on the basic toolkit of the language) and have solutions in a separate folder
